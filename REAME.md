# FAQ/Troubleshooting for TOP Students

This repo is the beginning of a collection of pages that will assist students following TOP (The Odin Project) curriculum.

## Purpose

Students following the TOP curriculum will seek assistance in the Discord server of TOP. I have found that, after assisting many students, that the vast majority of help requests are reoccurring issues that could be dealt with in a FAQ Troubleshooting guide.

## Why is the content here not on TOP?

It is my goal to have the content here moved or created on the TOP repository. TOP currently does not have a troubleshooting section. I intend to develop the content here and then present it to the moderators of TOP for them to consider adding it to TOP curriculum repository.
